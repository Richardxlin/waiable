Grid
Phase 1:
Help:
1. Link title (fixed at "Keyboard shortcuts are available here.")
2. Link href. Just like assets, set of html pages available via the gem.
3. Hidden element before the grid indicating help on how to focus/activate grid. This help should be browser-screen reader specific.
4. Additional help in case the first grid cell receives focus in Browse mode instead of Focus Mode.
