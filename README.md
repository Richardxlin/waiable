# Waiable

waiable gem is the Rails **W**&#8203;eb **A**&#8203;ccessibility **I**&#8203;nitiative for differently **able**.

This gem forces all Rails ActionView components to be compliant with WAI-ARIA standards.
It either overrides the existing ActionView components and also aims to add more widgets which are already accessibility compliant. 
Although we started with the accessibility widgets early on, we have now shifted our focus to 
first override the basic stuff like forms and web content (images/tables/page structure) that gets generated out of Rails core.
